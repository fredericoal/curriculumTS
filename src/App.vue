              <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
              <div class="paragraph">
                I have always been committed to my goals. I'm an easygoing person who has been passionate about
                technology since childhood.<br>

                I believe my soft skills are strong, as I have been able to adapt and grow quickly when exposed to new
                environments and challenges throughout my career. My key strengths include passion for what I do,
                resilience to think strategically about the future, and a solid mathematical background that helps me
                solve complex problems.<br>

                On a personal level, I love exploring new cultures through travel, and I also enjoy playing the piano as
                a hobby.<br>

                I have a background that spans both research and the industrial sector. I completed my PhD in
                Computer Science, where I worked with computer vision and information retrieval. I also hold a Master’s
                degree in Computer Science, during which I focused on improving the performance of a real-time algorithm
                for detecting planes in 3D.<br>

                My most recent experience was at Nelogica, where I had the opportunity to grow as both a manager and a
                leader. During my seven years there, I earned seven promotions - a reflection of my commitment,
                dedication, and drive to continually reach the next level.<br>

                As an engineering leader, I'm driven by curiosity, collaboration, and impact. I focus on empowering
                teams to deliver reliable, scalable, and user-centered products that create measurable business
                value.<br>

                Having lived in the United Kingdom for four years, I am now returning to Europe - a long-held personal
                goal - as my wife relocates to Tallinn, Estonia. This transition represents an exciting opportunity to
                continue growing professionally in an international environment.<br>

                I'm currently seeking roles as a Software Engineering Lead or Software Engineering Manager, where I can
                continue learning and advancing the state of the art in technology.

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              As a Manager, I have led a team of around 40 people, including four team leaders across six different
              teams. During this time, I had the opportunity to design and implement new processes to increase delivery
              efficiency, collaborate with cross-functional teams to build a scalable application, and use statistical
              data and client feedback to guide our development in the right direction.

              I successfully developed several projects aimed at optimizing our infrastructure and reducing company
              costs. These included refactoring and decomposing legacy systems, improving inter-application messaging,
              and identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.

              Additionally, I redesigned and enhanced the company's onboarding process and provided mentorship to
              aspiring leaders from other departments.

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              For nearly three years, I served as Tech Lead of the Profit platform, driving the technical direction and
              delivery of major projects aimed at expanding the software's capabilities. I led a front-end team focused
              on accelerating product growth by implementing new features, improving performance, and ensuring
              scalability. My leadership helped the company deliver faster, more robust updates to meet the growing
              demands of professional traders and investors.

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              I worked as a Senior Front-End Developer at Nelogica, a leading Brazilian fintech known for
              delivering advanced electronic trading platforms. I was part of the core team responsible for Profit, the
              company’s flagship platform used by active traders and investors throughout Latin America.

              My role focused on building high-performance user interfaces that support real-time market data
              visualization, technical analysis tools, and seamless order execution. I collaborated closely with
              back-end and product teams to ensure the front end could handle the speed and precision demanded by
              financial markets.

              Key contribution: I developed an optimized real-time data series system, designed to efficiently handle
              large volumes of tick and candlestick data while ensuring smooth, responsive updates on the user
              interface. This solution significantly improved chart performance and responsiveness, providing traders
              with an accurate and uninterrupted market view.
